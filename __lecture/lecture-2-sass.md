_or Syntactically Awesome StyleSheet._

---

We are moving on to `sass` and away from plain old `css`. ðŸ˜±

But why? What does this mean? OMG! I can't!

_Why now?_

---

## SASS Fact #1

SASS is CSS on steroids.

- You can continue to write plain old CSS inside of your `.scss` / `.sass` files.

---

## SASS Fact #2

There are two file types in which you can write SASS.

- `.sass` the original syntax.

  - more concise
  - easier to read
  - doesn't care about missing semi-colons

- `.scss` stands for _Sassy CSS_
  - more expressive
  - encourages proper syntax / nesting
  - encourages modular code
  - easier to document (comment)
  - works with existing CSS codebases
  - replace CSS?

## SASS Fact #3

Supercharged Syntax!

- Variables
- Mixins
- Nesting
- Functions

---

## SASS Fact #4

It needs to be compiled. Browsers don't speak SASS.

If you look at the `package.json`, you will notice that there is a dependency called `node-sass`.
